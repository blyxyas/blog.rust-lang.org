The Infrastructure Team is cleaning up GitHub organizations managed by the Rust Project
([rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang), [rust-dev-tools](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools), [rust-lang-deprecated](https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated), [rust-lang-nursery](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery) and [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer))
by removing members who are not part of any team within those organizations.

If you are currently a member of one of these GitHub organizations, you might receive a removal email from GitHub that notifies you that you have been removed from some of them.
If you are currently an active Rust team member, then do not worry! Your access to the `rust-lang` organization won't be affected by this, and at most we will remove you from some of the legacy organizations that are no longer in active use.

If you contributed to Rust in the past and you are no longer an active contributor, then we will likely remove you from all of the mentioned GitHub organizations.
We understand that some people publicly displayed their membership in the `rust-lang` organization as a recognition of past contributions.
As an alternative, your contributor status is shown on the official [teams page](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance#teams) of the Rust website, which includes an alumni section for each team.
Please reach out if your past team memberships are not reflected on this page. Also, we want to take this opportunity to thank you for the time you spent in the past making Rust what it is today!

If you have been removed from an organization you think you should be part of, or you have any other questions, please reach out on our chat platform, [Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/242791-t-infra/topic/removing.20inactive.20members.20from.20the.20org).

## Archived teams

Unfortunately, archived teams are not shown on the website's governance page, so previous Rust Project
members who were part of archived teams only won't be listed in any alumni section.

We created a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org/issues/2181) to track this,
but in the meantime we would like to thank these contributors in this post:

## Members without contact

Some past members are not listed in the [rust-lang/team](https://github.com/rust-lang/team) repo, so we
are unable to add them to the alumni sections and list them in the website.

If you are one of these members and want to be listed in the alumni sections of your previous teams,
please open a PR in the [rust-lang/team](https://github.com/rust-lang/team) repo.
